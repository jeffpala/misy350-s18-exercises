    <div id="Friends">
      <h2>Friends</h2>

      <p>
        Friends is a comedy sit-com and is consistently known as one of the best comedy shows of all time. This late 90's and early 2000's TV show is relateable and funny as a group of friends living in New York get themeselves in hilarious situations. I can
        watch any episode of this show and laugh every time. Here is a list of my top 3 favorite Friends' episodes. I also included a video of some of my favorite scenes.
        <ol>
          <li>"The One Where No One's Ready"</li>

          <li>"The One With Ross' Sandwich"</li>

        The Office was originally created in England, but America put its own spin on it as main character Michael Scott, played by Steve Carell, manages a paper company named "The Dunder Mifflin Paper Company." This show has over 100 episodes and is considered
        one of the best comedy shows of all time. Here is a link to some of my favorite scenes.

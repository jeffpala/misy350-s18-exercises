<p>A board game is a tabletop game that usually involves counters or pieces that or moved on board according to a certain set of rules. Some games are soley based on luck while other games are based on skill. To play a board game you need at least 2 people

  <h3>What is my Favorite Board Game?</h3>
  <p>My favorite board game is Monopoly. Monopoly is usually played with 2-4 people and is a great game to play with friends and family. It involves the perfect combination of skill and luck so every time you play it is a little different. Here are three
    reasons why Monopoly is my favorite game:
    <ul>
      <li>Many people can play at once</li>
      <li>There is enough skill involved that you can become good at the game</li>
      <li>Players get very into it which makes it very competitive</li>
    </ul>
    Here's a photo of what the game looks like
